    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>Have you ever felt being suffocated
      and losing internal peace . 
      Perhaps Not you’ll not feel in this Gen Z world cause the sound
      of ‘paisa hain to badi badi baat hain’ and ‘tujh main rabb dikta 
      hain ‘ is always what you heard. When you love someone and that 
      person is with you, you’re happy,  you sang ‘tujh me Rabb dikh 
      ta hain’ and when that same person leaves you, either you’re sad
      and calling bitch whom you named Rabb a little ago. You’ve let
      dictate your environment how you’ll react. If you’re in an environment 
      where people surrounding you likes you, equal to you in standard you’re
      happy. We’ve started building ourselves with the price of sacrificing 
      ourselves. You’re insecure of many things and let’s imagine for a moment 
      being in an pristine island now guess what you don’t have to worry about 
      your short height , dark skin or asymmetrical face and  of nothing . Does that mean we should stop doing everything cause everything we do is a product of urge the environment create . Let’s deep dive into it . Remember human being have flaws so inform me my mistake through contact section .</p>
